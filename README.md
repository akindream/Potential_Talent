# PROJECT: RHFBMkt0OI40Ecaj
# 🔍 AI-Powered Candidate Ranking System

## Overview

**Potential Talents** is an AI-driven pipeline designed to automatically evaluate and rank candidates based on their fitness for specific job roles. Built by a talent sourcing company, this project leverages a hybrid of classical NLP methods, deep learning, modern LLMs, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to streamline and improve talent discovery.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Predicts candidate fitness for a given role (e.g., *"Aspiring Human Resources"*)
* Ranks candidates based on semantic similarity and model scoring
* Adapts rankings in real time based on recruiter feedback ("starring")
* Finetuning with **QLoRA** on **DistilGPT2** and **RAG with Qwen**
* Uses a wide range of embeddings and scoring methods
* Integrates vector search (FAISS) for fast candidate retrieval

## 📊 Data Description

Each candidate record includes:

* `id`: Unique identifier
* `job_title`: Role or job title
* `location`: Geographical location
* `connection`: Connection count (e.g., “500+”)
* `fit`: Target label (fitness score between 0–1)

## 🧠 Methods & Models

### 🔡 Traditional Embeddings

* TF-IDF
* Word2Vec
* FastText
* GloVe

### 🔍 Semantic Embeddings

* SBERT (Sentence-BERT)

### 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)

* Qwen (via Hugging Face)
* LLaMA, DeepSeek, Phi (comparative tests)
* DistilGPT2 (finetuned via QLoRA)

### 🔁 Re-Ranking Engine

* RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation)
* FAISS for nearest-neighbor search
* Feedback-based re-ranking using RankNet and QLoRA

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Embed candidates with SBERT
2. Store vectors in a FAISS index
3. On query:

   * Retrieve top-k similar candidates
   * Pass to LLM (Qwen) via structured prompt
4. Generate a relevance-based fitness score
5. Re-rank based on feedback ("starred" candidates)
6. Finetune with QLoRA for supervised learning-to-rank

---

## ✅ Goals Achieved

* 🎯 Fitness scoring of candidates
* 🔝 Ranking with contextual understanding
* 🔁 Feedback-based re-ranking with model adaptation
* 🚫 Filtering out low-potential candidates via vector thresholds

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potential-talents.git
cd potential-talents
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📓 Run the Notebook

Use the Colab Notebook to:

* Load candidate data
* Build embeddings
* Query and rank candidates
* Visualize the re-ranking with feedback

---

## 💬 Feedback Logic

```python
# When a user "stars" a candidate, this triggers:
- Pairwise comparisons to guide ranking
- Update of the scoring model
- Reordering of candidate list based on preferences
```

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Integrate RLHF or adapter tuning for few-shot learning
* Add recruiter preference profiling
* Deploy as a web service or internal dashboard
